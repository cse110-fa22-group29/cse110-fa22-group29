## Agenda:

- ### Decide which project we're doing

  - We all seem to agree that the food review app is acceptable
  - Made a couple clarifications, no major changes or objections to the app

  - Finishing Risks + Rabbit holes here in the meeting
  - Kara posted a design prototype in Slack: https://cse110fall2022.slack.com/archives/C04598WA7P1/p1666918573779859

- ### App Description
  - Renaming it to a "Food Diary" app, not limited to UCSD
  - Allows users to store info about recent foods, restaurant name, location, price, your rating etc.
  - Probably provides food suggestions based on where you've eaten (and liked) before
  - We're not going to try anything with external data atm.

## Moving forward:

- ### BY TOMORROW:

  - FINISH PITCH SLIDES
  - MUST CHANGE DIAGRAM TO ALL RESTAURANTS (Isaac will change this)
  - Daniel will update the pitch slides by adding images/graphics.
  - Daniel + Sanjit are doing visual representation.
  - Gayvn is doing potential competitors
  - Henry, Sanjit, Kara are doing user personas
  - Rhea is doing statement + purpose
  - Arthur + Marc are doing "why it's a CRUD app"

  - See if we can have a short meeting tomorrow before meeting Gagan just to review our pitch.
  - Put all components in specs folder before pitch
  - Meet at 2:30? Meeting with Gagan is probably at 3:30

- ### LATER:
  - Have some people split off and work on the basic UI design. Technically Sanjit had the 'art role' according to the TA but not sure what that entails. More ppl would def be helpful. TBD who else is helping
