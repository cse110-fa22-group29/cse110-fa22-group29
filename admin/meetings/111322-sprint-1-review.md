## Sprint 1 REVIEW

In collecting feedback during our final sprint the leads decided to ask members individually about their experience during sprint 1 to then summarize these responses. Each member was asked 4 questions with their summarized responses below:

### What do you think worked well in the first sprint?

We resolved to hold each of our sprint 1 meetings in person with a remote option available to members that couldn't attend. We really liked hanging out at the restaurants before working on the sprint and these experiences encouraged psychological safety in the group. We made some noticeable progress which was very encouraging for the group. Specifically, we figured out quite a bit of the CI/CD pipeline details which will help us going forward and we got a solid grasp of what the visual aspects and feel of the website will be.

### What can we improve on for the next sprint?

We ran into trouble early on due to some lack of planning for specific tasks. The members agreed that we should have spent more time defining tasks for specific members and defining goals for our different teams (frontend, backend, and unit testing). There was some concern over members not being able to attend all meetings and we think this could have been fixed with regularly scheduled meetings. Some technical concerns were the Javascript unit testing pipeline development lagging behind code development and pipeline requirements being unclear. Perhaps we should write out a style document to guide the automated linting process.

### What was your contribution to the sprint?

- Rhea Bhutada: Worked on the backend features including how to get create new review card page to open in a new window
- Gavyn Etzel: Helped with javascript side of things for website
- Henry Feng: Local image store and meeting support
- Sanjit: Default photo design and frontend star rating css
- Daniel: Helped modify html, added upload file feature
- Arthur Lu: Added JS Linting, Unit testing pipeline actions and rote a few simple unit tests; added deployment pipeline action
- Marc Rheta: Added HTML Linting and CSS Linting
- Isaac Otero: Low and mid fidelity wireframes of how our page will look like, Started working on homepage.html
- George Dubinin: Meeting notes, Repo organization, cookies
- Kara Hoagland: CRUD backend functionality

### Was there anything blocking your progress in the sprint?

Communication was challenging especially for members that would attend over Zoom and it was a challenge keeping track of each member's progress. We ran into some issues with the branching strategy with branches rapidly multiplying at points and the GitHub tags not working. The biggest technical issue we experienced involved Node and ES6 compatibility issues.

Overall we feel that sprint 1 was a success with many lessons learned. Our enthusiasm for the project is only building and we are excited to get back into it with sprint 2 after a much needed short break.
