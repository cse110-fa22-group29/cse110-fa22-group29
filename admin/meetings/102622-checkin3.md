## Agenda:

- ### Present our ideas to Gagan

  - All ideas seem to be doable
  - Consider a few tweaks to "CRUDify" apps
  - Gagan is partial to food review app idea, but any of them can work

- ### Tips for projects

  - SOCIAL MEDIA ORGANIZER: avoid API integration if possible/only make it a small part, not a main feature
  - RESUME BUILDER: try to "CRUDify" it more if we're going for this

- ### Standups
  - Once per 2 days, 3 in worst case
  - Perhaps make a separate slack channel for these to avoid clutter

## Moving forward:

- ### BY FRIDAY:

  - Try and meet tomorrow (10/27) to make a final decision
  - Let Gagan know what we've decided on
  - Complete project pitch assignment - need to present to Gagan tomorrow 10/27, due on canvas 11/1

- ### OVER WEEKEND:
  - (If possible) Start on CI/CD pipeline (basic js app/unit tests, use Github actions to set up)

## End Time
