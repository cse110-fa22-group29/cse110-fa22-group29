# Final Project Topic Decision

- Status: accept
- Deciders: team members and TA
- Date: 10 / 27 / 22

## Decision Drivers

- Needed to develop a local-first, CRUD application that would be simple enough to implement in the next few weeks

## Considered Options:

- Social Media Archive
- Resume Builder
- Copy/Paste
- Food Journal

## Decision Outcome

Chosen Option: Food Journal, which allows users to hold their thoughts and ratings on meals and restaurants that they have been to. It is local-first, CRUD app, and fun. Therefore, we decided to choose this.
